# AtliQ Hardware Consumer Goods: (Ad-Hoc-Analysis & Insights)

## Project Overview and Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware, a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India with a global presence, specializes in selling computers and accessories.

The management identified a gap in actionable insights, making it difficult to make quick and informed business decisions. To address this, Tony Sharma (Data Analytics Director) plans to expand the data analytics team by hiring junior analysts. To assess both technical and analytical skills, he introduced an SQL challenge.

The company now seeks insights for 10 ad-hoc/business requests.

## Data Structure/ Data Modeling and Tools

The 'gdb023' (AtliQ_hardware database) was provided to me to work on and it includes six main tables:

1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data
1. dim_product: contains product-related data
1. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
1. fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
1. fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
1. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.

This is the data model I made for the visualization section of Power BI:-

**Tools used -** 

* Utilized MySQL to solve queries and extract insights.
* Used Power BI for data visualization and reporting.
